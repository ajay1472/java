I've created a comprehensive ICICI Banking API implementation in Java. Here are the key features included:
Main Components:
1. ICICIBankingAPI Class - Main API client with methods for:

Authentication - Login/logout functionality
Account Operations - Get account details, list all accounts
Balance Inquiry - Check account balance
Transaction History - Retrieve transaction records with date filters
Fund Transfers - Transfer money between accounts (IMPS/NEFT/RTGS)
Bill Payments - Pay utility bills
Beneficiary Management - Add and manage beneficiaries

2. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for:

Authentication (AuthRequest, AuthResponse)
Account information (Account, AccountDetailsResponse, BalanceResponse)
Transactions (Transaction, TransactionHistoryResponse)
Transfers (TransferRequest, TransferResponse)
Bill payments (BillPaymentRequest, PaymentResponse)
Beneficiaries (Beneficiary, BeneficiaryRequest, BeneficiaryResponse)

Key Features:

HTTP Client Integration using Java 11's built-in HttpClient
JSON Processing with Jackson ObjectMapper
Proper Error Handling with exception management
Security with API key and Bearer token authentication
Type Safety with BigDecimal for monetary amounts
Comprehensive Coverage of common banking operations

Dependencies Required:
xml<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.15.2</version>
</dependency>
Usage Example:
The code includes a complete example showing how to:

Initialize the API client
Authenticate with credentials
Perform various banking operations
Handle responses and errors
Properly logout

Note: This is a sample implementation for educational purposes. For production use, you would need to:

Use actual ICICI Bank API endpoints and documentation
Implement proper security measures (encryption, secure storage)
Add comprehensive error handling and validation
Include rate limiting and retry mechanisms
Add logging and monitoring capabilities

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation or add additional functionality?
